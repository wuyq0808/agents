# Airbnb MCP Server - Robots.txt Analysis

## Summary

The Airbnb MCP server requires the `--ignore-robots-txt` flag because **Airbnb specifically blocks search functionality** in their robots.txt file. This is an intentional design choice for ethical web scraping compliance.

## Technical Analysis

### Airbnb's Robots.txt Restrictions

Airbnb blocks these specific paths that the MCP server needs:
```
Disallow: /s/*?          # Blocks search queries  
Disallow: /s/*/homes     # Blocks home listing searches
```

The MCP server requests URLs like:
- `/s/Paris/homes?checkin=2025-09-15&checkout=2025-09-20`
- `/s/London/homes?adults=2&price_min=100`

These URLs match the blocked patterns `*/s/*?` and `/s/*/homes`.

### MCP Server Design Philosophy

**Ethical Defaults**: The server respects robots.txt by default as a best practice for responsible web scraping.

**Source Code Evidence**:
```typescript
// Checks robots.txt compliance for every request
if (!ignoreRobotsText && !isPathAllowed(path)) {
  return { error: "This path is disallowed by Airbnb's robots.txt" };
}

// Only bypass when explicitly configured
const IGNORE_ROBOTS_TXT = process.argv.includes("--ignore-robots-txt");
```

### Why Search Pages Are Public But Blocked

**Public Access**: URLs like `/s/Paris/homes` work fine in browsers - they're public content.

**Crawler Prevention**: Airbnb blocks *automated access* to search results to:
- Prevent large-scale data harvesting
- Protect competitive pricing information  
- Control server load from bots
- Maintain terms of service compliance

**Individual Listings**: Airbnb allows `/rooms/12345` (individual properties) but blocks bulk search access.

## Alternatives to `--ignore-robots-txt`

**None currently viable**. The MCP server fundamentally needs search functionality (`/s/*/homes`) which Airbnb explicitly blocks for automated tools.

**Possible future approaches**:
- Use Airbnb's official API (if available)
- Focus on individual listing details only
- Use alternative property search sources

## Conclusion

The `--ignore-robots-txt` flag is **necessary for educational/testing use** because Airbnb intentionally prevents automated search access while allowing human browser access. The MCP server correctly implements ethical defaults with explicit override capability.
